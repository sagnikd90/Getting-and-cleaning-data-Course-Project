This is a readme file for to understand the objectives of the project and how the scripts are linked with each other.


# Objectives of the project

1. Create a tidy dataset 

2. A link to the GitHub respository where the scripts and the data are saved

3. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

4. Analysis of the R Script
